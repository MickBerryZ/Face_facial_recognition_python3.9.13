# Face_facial_recognition_python3.9.13

This is a Face_facial_recognition_python3 that I implement by using Python 3.9.13. 

Thank you for Originally CHAITron channal on youtube to explain the code. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OH_KiCMyqE)

** I recommend to follow on my the step because I spend a lot of time to solve the problem of import face_recognition but the program unknown the library. **

1. install Vistual Studio (community) and selected 3 modules (Python development, Node.js development and Desktop development with C++)
2. Install Python version 3.9 to your PC (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.13/python-3.9.13-amd64.exe)
3. Install numpy (cmd and type: pip install numpy)
4. Install opencv-python (cmd and type: pip install opencv-python)
5. Install CMake (cmd and type : pip install CMake)
6. Install face_recognition (cmd and type : pip install face_recognition)

Now you are ready to implement the code, Let's have fun.
